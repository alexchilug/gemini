For users using GEMINI for GDR studies. 
GEMINI was recently modified following the work of 
Michal Ciemala see Acta. Phys. Pol. B44 611 (2013).
It now calculates the full gamma decay cascade.
For E1 decay, by default,  it uses a single Lorentzian
Line shape for the GDR where the centroid and width come from 
systematics. There is also the possibilty of a user defined
line shape if CNucleus::GDRParam = true. 
Use function CNucleus::setUserGDR() to change GDRParam. 

The user-defined line-shape is made up of a sum of up to 
5 Lorentzians. The strength, centroid and width of each of these
should be written to the file tbl/GDR.inp. The sum of the strengths
should add to unity. The width and centroid are in units of MeV.


 The gamma-ray energies in units of [MeV] are stored in 
CNucleus::GammaRayEnergy. These can be 
accessed with the function CNucleus::getGammaRayEnergy. The gamma-ray energies
are the energies in the frame of the decaying parent. No Dopler corrections 
have been made and no angle information is stored.

See the program testDecay.cpp for an example of the handling of the 
gamma-ray energies. program root2/fusion.cpp also 
makes some gamma-ray spectra.
