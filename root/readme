Instructions To Run geminni++ in the ROOT envirament


1) modify files to be compatible with root
  a) Nucleus.cpp, Fus.cpp and Angle.cpp. In each of these three file search
  for "ROOT" and then uncoment the following line so that ClassImp is defined

  b) CNucleus.h, CNuclide.h, CFus.h and CAngle.h. In each of these files
  search for ROOT and then uncomment the following line. There should be 
  two changes to each file except CNucleus.h where there is only one change 





2) copy the files in this directory to main GEMINI folder or 
to a copy of the main GEMINI folder 


3) ./autogen

4) make install

check to see where the libGemini.so file is written
try instance in ~/lib, but this make vary with the linux system

As an example of a script to run GEMINI++, run
gSystem.Load("libGemini.so")
.x testDecay.C

if there is a problem finding libGemini.so, you may want to move
it to the root libdir directory  (root-config --libdir)
or modify the script file.


more information on GEMINI++ can be found in the html directory
firefox index.html
or in gemini.pdf
